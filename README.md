Our goal is to determine the various factors that influence pet adoption in order to predict which 
pets are more likely to be adopted. This dataset is imperative in finding solutions focused on 
increasing pet adoption rates. Therefore, using machine learning to find predictions can be an 
important tool in finding these solutions.

## Dataset Description:
The Pet Adoption Dataset offers a thorough examination of the several variables that may affect a pet's chances of getting adopted from a shelter. This dataset contains comprehensive data on pets that are up for adoption, encompassing a range of traits and qualities.

## Questions:
1. How can we predict the adoption likelihood using Machine Learning?
    - We will create an analysis of existing data to make a classification.
2. How do certain factors affect the likelihood of a pet getting adopted?
    - Hypothesis: Pets who are younger in age are more likely to be adopted.
    - Analyzing the impact of various factors on adoption rates.

### We will be using:

Python Pandas

Matplotlib

ML - Neural Network Models/Scikit-learn

SQL
