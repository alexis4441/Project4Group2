Our goal is to determine the various factors that influence pet adoption in order to predict which 
pets are more likely to be adopted. This dataset is imperative in finding solutions focused on 
increasing pet adoption rates. Therefore, using machine learning to find predictions can be an 
important tool in finding these solutions.

## Dataset Description:
The Pet Adoption Dataset provides a comprehensive look into various factors that can influence
the likelihood of a pet being adopted from a shelter. This dataset includes detailed information 
about pets available for adoption, covering various characteristics and attributes.
## Questions:
1. How can we predict the adoption likelihood using Machine Learning?
    - We will create an analysis of existing data to make a classification.
2. How do certain factors affect the likelihood of a pet getting adopted?
    - Hypothesis: Pets who are younger in age are more likely to be adopted.
    - Analyzing the impact of various factors on adoption rates.

### We will be using:

Python Pandas

Tableau/Matplotlib

ML - Neural Network Models/Scikit-learn

# Project 4 Overview 
For Project 4, you will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
2. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.
3. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.
4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.
5. You must use at least two of the following:
    - Python Pandas
    - Python Matplotlib
    - HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
    - JavaScript Plotly
    - JavaScript Leaflet
    - SQL Database
    - MongoDB Database
    - Google Cloud SQL
    - Amazon AWS
    - Tableau
For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

## Finance
  - Create an algorithm that analyzes credit scores and predicts consumer personal-loan eligibility.
  - Using natural language processing, create a chatbot to perform simple tasks and help users find information.
  - Train an algorithm to analyze consumer spending and predict trends.
  - Train an image classifier to assess property value, which could then be used to calculate insurance quotes.

## Healthcare
  - Train an algorithm to recognize disease symptoms and predict if a patient is at risk.
  - Train an image classifier to recognize anomalies, such as suspicious vs healthy areas of skin.
  - Using natural language processing, create a chatbot that will help connect patients with doctors.
  - Create an algorithm to analyze patient history and predict the likelihood of inherited illness.

## Custom
We’ve only specified healthcare and finance, but any industry can benefit from machine learning. Consider preparing a 15-minute data deep dive or infrastructure review that shows machine learning in the context of what we’ve already learned.

  - Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.
  - Perform a deep dive on existing data using machine learning.
  - Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML (use Leaflet or Plotly to change the visualization).
  - Create an idea using mock data, and simulate how machine learning might be used.
  - Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
